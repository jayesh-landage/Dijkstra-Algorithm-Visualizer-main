# Dijkstra-Algorithm-Visualizer-main
A Tkinter-based visual tool to demonstrate Dijkstra’s algorithm. Users can add nodes and weighted edges, set source and target, and watch the shortest path found step by step. Uses NetworkX for graph logic and Matplotlib for animation. Displays distances, visited nodes, and final shortest path visually.
